title: Introduction
description: one-hook is a carefully crafted collection of React hooks, where each hook does one thing and does it well. Following the Unix philosophy of modularity, each hook is independently packaged and can be installed separately, ensuring minimal bundle size and maximum flexibility.

## Why one-hook?

React hooks have revolutionized how we manage state and side
effects in React applications. However, many hook libraries either:

- Bundle everything together, bloating your application with unused code
- Mix multiple concerns into single hooks, making them hard to test and maintain
- Lack proper TypeScript support and documentation

one-hook solves these problems by:

- Providing individually packaged hooks
- Following the single responsibility principle
- Offering first-class TypeScript support
- Maintaining comprehensive documentation

## Key Features

- ðŸŽ¯ **Single Responsibility**: Each hook does one thing exceptionally well.
- ðŸ“¦ **Tree-shakeable**: Import only what you need.
- ðŸ’ª **TypeScript-first**: Built with TypeScript for excellent type safety and IntelliSense support.
- ðŸ§ª **Well-tested**: Comprehensive test coverage for reliability.
- ðŸ“š **Well-documented**: Clear, concise documentation with practical examples.
- ðŸ”„ **Unified Versioning**: All hooks share the same version number for easy updates and maintenance.

## Getting Started

Install any hook individually:

```bash
npm install @one-hook/use-rerender
```

Or install multiple hooks:

```bash
npm install @one-hook/use-rerender @one-hook/use-another-hook
```
