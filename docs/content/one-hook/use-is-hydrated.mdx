title: useIsHydrated
description: Once `true`, no hydration error can occur.
---

Useful for preventing hydration mismatches by conditionally rendering content that depends on browser APIs.

```ts twoslash include imports
import { useIsHydrated } from '@1hook/use-is-hydrated'
```

Usage:

```tsx twoslash
// @include: imports
// ---cut---
const isHydrated = useIsHydrated()
```
