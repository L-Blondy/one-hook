Useful to prevent updates to unmounted components and avoid memory leaks in asynchronous operations or side effects.

## Usage

```tsx twoslash include imports
import { useGetIsMounted } from '@1hook/use-get-is-mounted'
```

Get the mounted state of the component at any time

```tsx twoslash
// @include: imports
// ---cut---
const getIsMounted = useGetIsMounted()

console.log(getIsMounted())
```
