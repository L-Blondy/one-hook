title: useIsHydrated
description: Once `true`, no hydration error can occur.
---

Prevent hydration mismatches by conditionally rendering content that depends on browser APIs.

## Installation

```package-install
npm install @1hook/use-is-hydrated
```

## Usage

```tsx twoslash include imports
import { useIsHydrated } from '@1hook/use-is-hydrated'
```

Check if the component is hydrated:

```tsx twoslash
import React from 'react'
// @include: imports
// ---cut---
function MyComponent() {
  const isHydrated = useIsHydrated()

  if (!isHydrated) return null

  return <div>{Date.now()}</div>
}
```
