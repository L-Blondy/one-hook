description: Transform anything into a ref. The ref is always up to date in effects and DOM events.

`useLatestRef` transforms any value into a ref that can be used in:

- DOM event handlers
- useEffect

```tsx twoslash include imports
import { useLatestRef } from '@1hook/use-latest-ref'
```

Usage:

```tsx twoslash
// @include: imports
type Value = any[]
const value: Value = []
// ---cut---
const ref = useLatestRef(value)
```

We can now read the latest `value` in effects without triggering the effect.

```tsx twoslash
// @include: imports
import { useEffect } from 'react'
type Value = any[]
const value: Value = []
// ---cut---
const ref = useLatestRef(value)

useEffect(() => {
  // only runs once
}, [ref])
```
