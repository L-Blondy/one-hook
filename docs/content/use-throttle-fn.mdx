title: useThrottleFn
description: A throttle function, reactified.
---

Ensures that a function is only executed once in a specified time interval, no matter how many times it is invoked.

## Installation

```package-install
npm install @1hook/use-throttle-fn
```

## Usage

```tsx twoslash include imports
import { useThrottleFn } from '@1hook/use-throttle-fn'
```

The `useThrottleFn` hook accepts an interval in milliseconds and returns a `throttle` function.

The first call executes right away, while subsequent calls within interval are throttled. \
The final call is scheduled to run after the interval expires.

```tsx twoslash
// @include: imports
const console = { log: (..._: any[]) => {} }
// ---cut---
const { throttle } = useThrottleFn(1000)

throttle(() => console.log('Executes immediately'))
throttle(() => console.log('Skipped'))
throttle(() => console.log('Scheduled to execute after 1000ms'))
```

Override the default interval:

```diff lang='tsx'
const { throttle } = useThrottleFn(1000)

throttle(() => console.log('Executes immediately'))
throttle(() => console.log('Scheduled to execute after 500ms'), 500)
```

Use `trailing: false` to avoid scheduling the last call:

```tsx twoslash
// @include: imports
const console = { log: (..._: any[]) => {} }
// ---cut---
const { throttle } = useThrottleFn(1000, { trailing: false })

throttle(() => console.log('Executes immediately'))
throttle(() => console.log('Skipped'))
```

Cancel pending executions:

```tsx
const { throttle, cancel, isPending } = useThrottleFn(1000)

isPending && cancel()
```

When the component unmounts, pending executions are automatically canceled.
